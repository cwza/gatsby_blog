## First Incredible Video
Notes of this incredible video about [How to Do 90% of What Plugins Do (With Just Vim)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA2WjJbmmoM)

### Find Files and Buffer
* :find *.cpp
* :ls (list buffers)
* :bd (buffer delete)

### ctags jump
* Use ^] to jump to tag under cursor
* Use g^] for ambiguous tags
* Use ^t to jump back up the tag stack
* ^o, ^i to jump between cursors

### Auto-Complete
* Use ^n and ^p to go back and forth in the suggestion list
* ^x^n for JUST this file
* ^x^f for filenames (works with our path trick!)
* ^x^] for tags only
* ^n for anything specified by the 'complete' option

### File-Browsing
* :edit a folder to open a file browser
* v/t to open in an h-split/v-split/tab
* check |netrw-browse-maps| for more mappings

### Window 
* gt/gT/2gt to switch tabs
* ^w j, ^w k, ^w l, ^w h to move cursor between pane
* ^w x to switch pane
* ^w _, ^w |, ^w = to adjust size
* :vsp, :sp to open new split

### Help
* :help i_^n (Tell me what does ctrl-n do in insert mode), :help c_^n for command mode
* :helpgrep window (grep for all window appearance in the entire help), use :cn, :cp, :cl to navigate

### Fold and Unfold
* zf in visual mode to add fold
* zc, zo to close fold and open fold
* zr/R, zm/M to close all fold and open all fold

### Install Plugins


### Plugins
* git clone plugin into ~/.vim/pack/plugins/opt or ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start
* :packadd to manually start package which is installed in opt

### Generate Ctags
``` bash
ctags -R --kinds-c++=+pZ --fields-c++=+{specialization}{template}{properties}{captures} --languages=c++ -f
```
