## +inf
* Use 0x7f if you don't need to add this value to others
* Use 0x3f if you need to add this value to others (useful for relax operation in shortest path algorithm)

``` cpp
int d[10];
memset(d, 0x3f, sizeof(d));
```

## -inf
* Use 0x80 if you don't need to substract other values.
* Use 0xc0 if you need to substract other values.
