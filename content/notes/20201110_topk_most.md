## Algorithm
1. Build a frequency hash map
2. Push them into Heap(Priority Queue), Frequency as priority
   During push if heap size > k, pop the top
3. Time: O(nlogk), Space: O(n+k)

## Sample Code
``` python
def topKFrequent(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    "Time: O(nlogk), Space: O(n+k)"
    counter = Counter(nums)
    heap = []
    for val, freq in counter.items():
        heapq.heappush(heap, (freq, val))
        if len(heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
    return [val for freq, val in reversed(heap)]
nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
k = 2
result = topKFrequent(nums, k)
assert result == [1, 2]
```
